## Core architecture

[x] - Fix view config shit? this way color processing would work
[x] - Fix native modules?
[x] - Make native modules stable & dynamic - Fix getConstants use case & crash
[x] - Checkout how iOS works so i can get started designing a stable API
[ ] - Create a "SyncRenderer" and a "SyncView", this will also help with debugging (to render just one view instead of a whole list!)
[ ] - Do I want to use the ReactFiberConfig? (what do i mean by that?)
[ ] - Implement the main list API lol
[ ] - I think fast refresh is crashing the app right now?
[ ] - There was some react tag collision as we are reusing the same fabric ui manager … thats why i just started the tags from 1mil. Idk, seems dirty, and is potentially something we'd like to address in the future by running our own instance?

## Base functionality (what users expect to just work)

[x] - Try pressability stuff (even emitter - i think that should just work tbh, at least the emitting part)
[x] - Do I have to implement getPublicInstance so people can work with refs as expected?
[ ] - RNGH / reanimated (i guess?)
[ ] - When trying to use RNGH it says: Error: GestureDetector must be used as a descendant of GestureHandlerRootView. Otherwise the gestures will not be recognized. - The problem is that they render a react context to check for the gesture detector - Either i need to add WrapperComponent prop support (i think i still have to do this) - But there might be other more severe issues with running RNGH

## Performance

[ ] - Create a custom view manager so i don't have to inject empty views to keep the indices correct - Benchmarking before after would be interesting! - I guess that could be huge, for 10k list items, it created 10k dummy views right now!
[ ] - Move the commit to root into the render phase function for earlier execution - Would be nice to properly benchmark the diff

## Stability

[ ] - Fix the crash by delaying setting the adapter after the render phase - I think the issue is really that the adapter fill will be requested on layout
[ ] - Fix crash during hot reload
[ ] - Test with worklets global strict mode
[ ] - (Android) There is an issue with the how the mounting item dispatcher works. I think it only executes at choreographer frame interval, but
we basically want it to "force render" something for our view. In 90% of cases the window is hit, but sometimes the app crashes here
because the view has not yet rendered out.
